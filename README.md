Fictional dental clinic - project


This is project for my portfolio. All characters and information are fictitious. 
I used HTML, CSS(SASS) and 3 lines of Javascript. 

Page is responsive on different devices.

Navigation bar is sticky through the page and collapses into navigation menu button when hitting small screen (mobiles). 
Active navigation menu on small screens has full view background and closes when user hits one of the links and navigates to clicked element/section.

Registration form is popup, requires correct email adress and password with minimum length of 6 letters(symbols).

Telephone number button/link lets to call directly from the page. 

Map is responsive.
